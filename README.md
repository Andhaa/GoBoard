Original design in this [Onshape-Project](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/b5e3aa80c0473fccdcfa36a3/w/416390dcb99cf1732b89929b/e/f7f63c7c95c05830403a44de?renderMode=0&uiState=67641a55a0fb78669a34887a)
## Known issues
The LED's are a little dimmer than without the case. A better choice would be using light pipes. 
Current solution is cheaper and involves less assembly.
